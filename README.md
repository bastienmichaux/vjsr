How do you make a single-page app with TS, but without using a web framework ?

**To do:**
* add gulp, gulp-sass, gulp-uglify, gulp-concat
* yarn + scripts
* babel (for Chrome CORS issue with import/export)
* mocha (on src or dist)
* use import/export while keeping ES2015 as the ts module option
* webpack ?
